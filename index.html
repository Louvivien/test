<h2>About Disc Golf</h2>
<p>Disc golf is a flying disc sport in which players throw a disc at a target; it is played using rules similar to golf. It is often played on a course of 9 or 18 holes. Players complete a hole by throwing a disc from a tee area toward a target, throwing again from the landing position of the disc until the target is reached. Usually, the number of throws a player uses to reach each target is tallied, and players seek to complete each hole in the lowest number of total throws.</p>
<p>Disc golf is a great way to enjoy the outdoors, get some exercise, and have fun with friends. It's a sport that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels. Whether you're a casual player looking for a new hobby or a competitive player aiming for championships, disc golf offers something for everyone.</p>
